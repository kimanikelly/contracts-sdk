## Summary

The goal of this Software Development Kit was to build accessible abstractions from the [Smart Contracts](https://github.com/kimanikelly/contracts) repository as Python Classes that can be easily installed in a server-side environment and allow communication between the Off-Chain applications and Ethereum compatible protocols. The Smart Contract instances are pre-built through [Contracts-API](https://github.com/kimanikelly/contracts-api), making it easier for a user to connect and perform read/write functionality in other projects.

## Test PyPI Package Installation

```
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ smart-contracts-sdk
```

## Source Code Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/kimanikelly/contracts-sdk.git
